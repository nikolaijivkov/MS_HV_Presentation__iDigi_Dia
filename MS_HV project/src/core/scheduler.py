"""\
    The scheduler provides a centralized scheduler resource to
    minimize the number of thread resources devoted simply to time-keeping
    between periodic or otherwise timed operations.

    The scheduler is appropriate to use if your periodic operations
    will not perform blocking operations.  This is not enforced in the
    code.  Any blocking operations will degrade the performance of the
    entire system and cause delays in the execution of scheduled tasks
    throughout.

        Dia core service which provides centralized scheduling resources
    
        Rather than require all modules in the system to have to spawn
        threads to perform periodic operations, the scheduler operation
        allows these work items to be scheduled.

        Parameters:

        * `core_services` - The
          :py:class:`~core.core_services.CoreServices`
          object of the system

        The main scheduler for the system is created by the system.
        It is not necessary to create additional schedulers to
        schedule periodic tasks.

        The `Scheduler` class primarily exists to wrap the
        functionality of the generic
        :py:class:`~common.sched_async.SchedAsync` base class and
        register as a core service.  See the public members of that
