    Core object for system traversal and service access

    The `CoreServices` object acts as a central clearing house for
    access to the wide variety of objects present in a running Dia
    instance.

    Using this object you may:

    * Access and manage settings for the entire system
    * Retrieve device, presentation and service instances from the
      system
    * Initialize a new running Dia system.

    When run through an interactive session, a `CoreServices` object
    is returned from the `main()` routine.

    Example::

        >>> import dia
        >>> core_obj = dia.main()
        Determining platform type... PC host environment assumed.

        Python version mismatch! Digi='2.4.3 or 2.6.1', Current='2.4.5'
        iDigi Device Integration Application Version 1.3.8
        Using settings file: dia.yml
        Core: initial garbage collection of 0 objects.
        Core: post-settings garbage collection of 28 objects.
        Starting Scheduler...
        Starting Channel Manager...
        Starting Device Driver Manager...
        Starting Presentation Manager...
        Web Presentation (web0): using port 8001 and BaseHTTPServer
        XMLRPC(xmlrpc): starting server on port 8080
        Starting Services Manager...
        Core services started.
        >>> print core_obj
        <core.core_services.CoreServices instance at 0xb7744e2c>
        >>>

    Parameters:

    * `settings_flo` - An object implementing the Python file API to
      provide access to settings content.
    * `settings_filename` - The filename to use for saving settings.
      This may be the same as the file used to provide `settings_flo`
    * `shutdown_event` - A threading.Event object used to signal final
      shutdown to the main thread dia.py (so it may be interrupted from
      sleeping between garbage collections).
