"""
A threaded scheduler implementation that can be stopped asynchronously.

An instance of :class:`SchedAsync` will create the scheduler.  The scheduler
manages a list of events to execute after a time interval has elapsed.  When
the scheduler is in-between events it will sleep.

This scheduler uses :py:mod:`digi_sched` which is based upon the
Python standard libraries `sched` implementation.  If this scheduler
gets behind, it simply gets behind.  It offers no real-time
guarantees.

Using this scheduler may be beneficial when architeching an application to
avoid the creation of threads.  Although it is possible to create an
application with many threads to control periodic activities, doing so may
be wasteful in a resource contrained environment as each thread created
will allocate its own stack.

In the iDigi Dia an instance of this scheduler is created at system
startup time and is available as a :py:class:`core service
<core.core_services.CoreServices>`.  You may access the scheduler
service in a manner similar to the below example::

    sched_handle = self.__core.get_service("scheduler")
    sched_handle.schedule_after(5.0, function_to_call, 'function', 'arguments')
