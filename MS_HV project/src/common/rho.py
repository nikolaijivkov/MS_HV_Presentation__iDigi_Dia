#   Pollard Rho factorization from Kirby Urner,
#   http://www.mathforum.org/epigone/math-teach/blerlplerdghi
# ======================================================================

#
# Further modified and optimized by Jordan Husney <jordanh@digi.com>
#  - Added acceptance criteria check function.
#  - Changed range() to xrange() generator function.
