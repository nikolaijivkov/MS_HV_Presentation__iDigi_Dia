"""
An implementation of an abstract modular dynamic class loading service.

The :class:`AbstractServiceManager` is used to implement several core system
services including the :class:`DeviceDriverManager`, 
:class:`LoggingManager`, :class:`PresentationManager`, and others.  The
:class:`AbstractServiceManager` defines an interface for these services to
conform to as well as implement several helper functions to facilitate the
dynamic loading of module code, start and stop class instances, and manage
child services.
