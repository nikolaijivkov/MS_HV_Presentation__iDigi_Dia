"""
The settings base class.

Any objects in the system that wish to have their settings serialized
in the system-standard way should inherit from the
:class:`SettingsBase` class which is defined in this module.

Regardless of the serialization used, the configuration files consist
of a tree-like representation of the settings specified for the
system.  The following sections will attempt to introduce some
concepts and internal representation used by the :class:`SettingsBase`
and :class:`SettingsContext` classes.

.. _instance_lists:

Instance Lists
====================

The tree-like representation of the settings specified by the
configuration files can have branches specified essentially as
`dictionary` or `sequence` types.  Traversing a dictionary of
dictionaries can be done by specifying only the keys used to perform
the traversal.  However, sequences can have multiple alternate meaning
as a portion of the settings tree.

One meaning is that of a leaf setting.  The sequence itself is
intended to be consumed as an entire setting by the
:class:`SettingsBase` object that will consume it.  Examples of this
include the `channels` setting in the
:doc:`iDigi DB </user/presentations/idigi_db>` presentation or the
`exclude` settings of the :doc:`Embedded Web
</user/presentations/embedded_web>` presentation.

However, for convenience and cleanliness of the saved representation,
some sequences are really better located by a symbolic key rather than
as a complete sequence.  This is where the settings infrastructure of
the system introduces the concept of an *instance list*.

During the translation of a serialized representation into the
run-time representation, the settings code recognizes sequences of
dictionaries in the settings tree where the dictionaries have a `name`
key and converts them to a modified form.  This modified form is
inserted into the run-time representation of the settings as an
`instance_list` setting.  This allows for the list to be retrieved by
name the same as all other settings in the system and provides a
consistent means to specify a path for settings traversal to deeper
nodes of the settings tree.

Some drivers may wish to access this list as a whole; for example the
:doc:`Transforms </user/devices/transforms>` device retrieves its
entire settings block as an instance list for additional processing.

Most of the time however, these instance lists act as a convenience
for traversing the tree by specifying the traversal as a :ref:`binding
<bindings>`

.. _bindings:

Bindings
====================

A :class:`SettingsBase` binding is a sequence.  Each element of
the sequence specifies a path in the settings registry that can be
used to locate a sub-tree of the whole.

Strings at the top level of the binding sequence select a literal
string specified path in the settings.  These are items that are
specified as dictionary keys in the settings serialization.  Examples
are the top-level `devices`, `services`, `presentations` or `loggers`
keys used to organize the configuration file or the `settings` key
present for the standard representation of the top level settings
block of each component.

If the top level of the binding sequence is also a sequence, this is
used to identify the member of an :ref:`instance_list
<instance_lists>`.

Example
--------------------
Consider the following very simple YAML document

dia.yml::

  devices:
  - name: template
    driver: devices.template_device:TemplateDevice
    settings:
        update_rate: 5.0

To locate the settings for the template device on the settings tree,
the following binding would be used::

  ('devices', ('template',), 'settings')

Thankfully, in most instances, bindings will be managed by the system.

    `settings_binding` is a sequence representing a settings path.  As new

    class and is fully aware of its internals.
    :class:`SettingsContext` objects are used to view and manipulate
