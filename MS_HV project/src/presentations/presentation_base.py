**iDigi Dia Presentation Base**

A Presentation is an iDigi Dia module which is responsible for 
gathering sample data from channels and re-presenting the data in another 
format. Presentation_base provides a class (PresentationBase) which defines
the necessary initialization and execution methods that such a presentation
would need to implement.

    presentations should begin by importing PresentationBase, i.e.::

    At minimum, all iDigi Dia presentation modules must implement the 
    `__init__`, `start`, and `stop` methods defined below.
