"""
Cleanse python lists, objects, tuples, etc. into valid JSON.

Use regular expressions to tokenize valid structures, such as singly and
doubly quoted strings, integers and floats.  Anything that doesn't match
an integer, float, or double-quoted string is converted to a double-quoted
string -- single quotes around strings are converted to double quotes.
Additionally, a valid token must be followed by a valid separator: [{,}]
and : for hashes.  Tuples are converted to lists.  JSON recognizes certain
control characters (\\n, \\r, etc.), and these are also represented
correctly.

Triple single and double quoted strings are not recognized, although they
could be added easily.

Also, the list of accepted "afters" should really only include ,]}:.
