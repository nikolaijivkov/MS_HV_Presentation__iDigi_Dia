"""
ChannelSource objects manage the interface differences between referencing
the get()/set()/refresh() methods on a device property and a native
channel object.

A device's values are known as properties.  Each property has one or more
unique names associated with it, an inital value, access permissions,
options mask, and callback functions.

Permissions for a property are set in the form of a mask and are defined to
be one or more of the following:

* **DPROP_PERM_GET:** values from this property can be read
* **DPROP_PERM_SET:** values from this property can be written
* **DPROP_PERM_REFRESH:** this property is allowed to be arbitrarily updated

* **DPROP_OPT_AUTOTIMESTAMP:** set time automatically on samples from a driver
* **DPROP_OPT_DONOTLOG:** do not log any channel operations associated with
                          this device propery.
* **DPROP_OPT_DONOTDUMPDATA:** a hint to presentations to not include this
                               channel in channel dumps.

.. note::

   These are the same as the :ref:`permissions <permissions>` and
   :ref:`options <options>` in :mod:`~channels.channel`
