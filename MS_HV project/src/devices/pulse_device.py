"""\
A device driver with the capability of pulsing a single Boolean channel to
its opposite Boolean value for a specified period of time, after which it
will return to its original Boolean value.

For example,
You may use this driver as a channel_source for a DIO device.  If your
output is False to begin with, and you want to pulse it true for 5 seconds
and then have it go back to false, you can do that with this driver.
You would set that up by setting initial_value to False, and setting
duration to 5.

A 'stop pulse' feature is also added for reverting settings to their initial
value before they are scheduled to revert.  This is useful because if you 
have a long pulse and want to stop it for any reason, you will be able to.
This feature is always enabled, so you can stop a pulse at any time
by setting this channel to its initial value.

Settings:
    duration:   Float - The duration of a pulse in seconds.
                Not Required - Default value is 5.0 (seconds)
    
    initial_value:  Boolean - The initial value you want the channel to be 
                    set to.  If this setting is set to false, the channel
                    will go from false, go to true for a period of time, and
                    return to false.
                    Not Required - Default value is False
                    
Properties:
    pulse_channel:  The Boolean channel source that will pulse it's opposite
                    Boolean value for a specified period of time.
