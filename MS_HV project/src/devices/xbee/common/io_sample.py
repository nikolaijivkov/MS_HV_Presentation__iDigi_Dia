"""\
    A simple parser for XBee I/O samples.

    Most XBee devices support retrieving of both Analog and Digital
    samples from the device.
    This is done by issuing the DDO 'IS' command, in which the unit
    will pack its AIO and DIO values into the response.

    This file offers a helper function to decode the response for the user.
