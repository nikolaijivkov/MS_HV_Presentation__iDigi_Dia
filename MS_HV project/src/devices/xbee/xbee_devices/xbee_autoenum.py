"""\
A Dia Driver for Discovering and Auto Enumerating XBee Devices.

   Instead of defining an exact collection of Dia devices with fixed XBee MAC
   addresses, the user lists the type of adapters to support and their default
   configurations.  This driver then automatically imports and configures new
   adapters as seen on the XBee network.

   Device names default to the NI (node identifier) of the XBee.  If this value
   is not set or unavailable, then the device name shall be like
   'tag_[00:13:a2:00:40:52:e0:fc]!', where 'tag' is the string defined in the
   'devices' portion of the settings file as 'name: tag'

   While the driver runs, it will periodically issue an XBee discover out
   to the XBee network, attempting to find new devices to Auto-Enumerate.
   It will also listen into XBee traffic inbound in to the Gateway,
   and if it detects any traffic that any of the given devices set up might
   send in on, it will check to see if it is a new device, and if so, attempt
   to configure the device into Dia.
