"""\
A special XBee Config block which performs a simulated commissioning
button press to wake up potentially sleeping nodes.
"""

# TODO/FIXME, Question: Rather than a CB=1, perhaps we could wake up for the
# entire sequence by doing a SM=0?  We would need immediate apply, but
# not necessarily WR.  That gives us more time and may have less
# visible side-effects.  Needs consideration.

# The con to modifying SM is that it won't get reset unless there's a
# sleep block following us.  That may not happen.
